## A Gentle Intro to TypeScript

### What, why, how?
- What?
  - A *syntactic superset* of JavaScript: All JS code is legal TS
  - Adds explicit typing to JavaScript
  - Fancy linter - helps at build/compile time
  - Three parts: Language, Language Server, Compiler

- Why?
  - Helps devs to express *intent* in code, and formally enforce constraints
  - Catches errors before run time

- How?
  - Transpiled into JS with the TS compiler as part of build step
